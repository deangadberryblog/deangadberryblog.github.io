title:  "Realizing the Reality of Inefficiency"

I have come to the recognition that I am employed in the midst of inefficiences.

When I am tasked with some repetitive function, I quickly notice improvements which can be made. Many small time-saving-measures over 7 months can amount to a week or two of working time saved. This has always been my mindset.

I can share about what I have already done. I was tasked with the production of 6000 similar data sheets given on-site images. Mostly, this was a data-entry process. It did, however involve some formatting functions and evaluation of documentation regarding the on-site images. The process of compiling all of this data was given to me in May with the expectation of 40 / 6000 per day. At the peak of my efficiency cycle, I was achieving upwards of 70 / 6000 per day.

The constant formatting was a click-click-click process. Alt-based macros bound to a 16-key mouse solved that inefficiency. I noticed the lack of vim-motions in the process. I was constantly moving between my keyboard and mouse to select required materials. I needed to implement vim-motions and reduce fatigue. This, I implemented with the purchase of a Kinesis Advantage 360 keyboard which I proceeded to program with vim-motions. This same keyboard was then granted those aforementioned macros and more and more macros as time went on. Macros which would format and print a document. Macros which would select many items and hide them when necessary. Really some complex stuff. Some of the longer macros were 30+ keystrokes. I can click one button and sit back for a minute while the keyboard does the work.

Not only did these micro-saves increase the efficiency of the process, I really got a rush each time one of them was optimized.

There is, however, a flaw in the motivating force to continue to make more efficient: The need for positive affirmation and reassurance of the efficacy of my efforts. Without this, my morale would sink and crash within a day or two. This especially occurred when I hit a plateau and was no longer able to find maximal responses to my efforts and cutting bloat.

Finally, I contacted the Project Manager who was distributing the standards and I spoke with him about changes which would make the process faster. I created my own templates to work off of, and I evened out. I was able to exceed expectations because of my insatiable desire to be faster and more efficient. There is more of this efficiency in the works, too. I am currently learning how to use a new software. My concern is that deliverables are required in PDF format, and I think that transferring to a different format would speed things up.

I have ideas about making team collaboration more effective by moving a few individuals. I have ideas for making the entire office adopt a split keyboard as standard too. But, you know, I am hired with the understanding that there are inefficiencies in the processes which I must execute each day. I will continue to find ways to make things more efficient, but until I have my Six-Sigma Black Belt, I doubt I will be taken seriously
